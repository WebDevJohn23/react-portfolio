# React Portfolio (Headless WordPress + ACF)

This project is a personal portfolio built with **React (Vite)** and powered by a **Headless WordPress backend** using **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)**.
It demonstrates how to fetch structured content from a CMS and render it dynamically on a modern frontend.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ Headless WordPress Integration

All content (hero text, about section, projects, tech stack, contact info) is managed through WordPress using ACF fields.
The React app fetches these via the WP REST API and renders them as plain text.

### ✔ React Components & Clean Structure

The project uses a clear structure for:

- Layout
- Page sections
- API utilities
- Reusable components

### ✔ Safe, Clean Rendering

All dynamic fields are sanitized and rendered cleanly.

### ✔ EmailJS Contact Form

The contact form sends messages via EmailJS using service ID, template ID, and public key.

### ✔ Fast Build with Vite

Instant HMR and optimized production build.
